* A praise and critique of Enlightenment

In Goethe's portrayal of Dr. Faustus, we encounter the epitome of the
Enlightenment ethosâ€”a scholar driven by an unwavering faith in reason and the
relentless pursuit of knowledge through human intellect. Yet, as this scholar,
having pushed reason to its utmost limits, gazes into the abyss of existential
emptiness, he is besieged by ennui. He discovers that reason alone is
insufficient to provide meaning and fulfillment. Thus, Dr. Faustus becomes a
herald of the decline of the Enlightenment era, signaling the end of the
revolutions in science, philosophy, and politics catalyzed by pure human
intellect.

Through Goethe's artistic lens, we receive a critical examination of the
Enlightenment. Nietzsche, too, identifies the emergence of the "tyranny" of
reason, or the enlightenment spirit, tracing its roots back to Socrates, who
instills seeds of doubt. The notion of reason as the exclusive avenue to Truth
and the pursuit of Truth as the pinnacle of virtue find perfect embodiment in
Dr. Faustus. However, the poignant question arises: why has the pursuit of such
lofty ideals led Dr. Faustus into a morass of discontent and disillusionment?
Can there be salvation for our dear Dr. Faustus amidst this existential turmoil?

Departing from the traditional portrayal of Doctor Faustus as inherently evil,
Goethe reimagines the narrative as a wager between Faust and Mephistopheles, set
against the cosmic backdrop of a bet between God and Satan. Faust embodies the
relentless pursuit of knowledge rather than malevolence. Despite mastering all
available knowledge and skills, Faust finds his lifelong quest ultimately
futile, lamenting, "...for all our science and art / we can know nothing, it
burns my heart." Driven by an insatiable thirst for wisdom and accomplishment,
Faust delves into magic and transgression, seeking to surpass conventional
limits.

Upon striking a pact with Mephisto, Faust embarks on a journey with his infernal
companion. Their escapades begin with revelry in Leipzig before Mephisto
facilitates Faust's rejuvenation through a potion obtained from a witch, erasing
thirty years of age. And so on.... and there is Gretchen.


Is there salvation for our dear Dr. Faustus? Will activity redeem him and us for
that matter? Are being and doing the same? 


* Formal Structure
Goethe employs a variety of poetic meters throughout /Faust/ to convey different
moods and themes. The poetic form is closely linked to the content. For example,
he deploys tragic forms, in the second part, when he is writing about Ancient
Greece, he uses typically Greek forms. He incorporates other meters such as
trochaic, anapestic, and dactylic meters in different sections of the text to
add musicality at times and compliment the content. Rhyme is also utilized
throughout "Faust" to enhance its poetic quality.

Beyond meter and rhyme, other formal structures present in "Faust" include the
use of dramatic monologues, soliloquies, and choral interludes. These structures
serve to deepen characterization, provide insights into the characters' inner
thoughts and struggles, and engage the reader or audience in philosophical
reflections.
